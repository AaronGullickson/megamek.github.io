### Mission Statement

The MegaMek organization maintains a series of programs that try to implement the published rules for the table top BattleTech game published by [Catalyst Game Lab](https://www.catalystgamelabs.com/) as faithfully as is practical. These programs are designed with the idea of being accessible, both in portability across various operating systems and across various hardware configurations.

All programs are [open source](https://opensource.org/faq#osd) and distributed under the GPL.
