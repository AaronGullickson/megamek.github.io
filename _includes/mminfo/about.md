The MegaMek suite of programs allow you to play out tactical turn-based battles and military campaigns in the [Battletech Universe](https://bg.battletech.com/universe/), with tanks, infantry, battle armor, aerospace fighters, warships, and most importantly, the mighty Battlemech -- king of the battlefield. The programs provide a modern, computerized version of the [Battletech tabletop game](https://bg.battletech.com/), as well as a variety of features for running campaigns and customizing units. The three programs that make up the MegaMek suite are:

- **MegaMek**: Play out [Battletech](https://bg.battletech.com/) games online against human opponents, or against the built-in AI. MegaMek is packed full of customizable options that allow you to play the game your way.
- **MekHQ**: Generate your own personal force (e.g. mercenary unit, line regiment, pirates, etc.) with a full TO&E, experience and skill upgrades for personnel, a repair system, and much more, all within the canon factions and worlds of the [Battletech Universe](https://bg.battletech.com/universe/). 
- **MegaMekLab**: Customize and build your own units, such as mechs, tanks, and warships, using the official rules. You can then use these units in MegaMek and MekHQ or print out record sheets for use in tabletop play.
