We are an open source project so anyone is welcome to help.  Consider what you can offer, also you should make sure you join our Slack channel [here.](http://megamek.org:3000/) It's important for us to be able to easily communicate and Slack allows us that.

**I know how to code**

Great, the projects are in Java. But first give our [Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/MegaMek-Coding-Style-Guide) a read. Next, our preferred method for someone to help with code is to start small. Have a look at the tracker grab a bug or RFE and start there. If you play and have found something that needs improvement, submit a PR for it.

The core developers will review all PR's and provide feedback to ensure things aren't going to break existing save games or the program itself.  PR reviews happen as the core developers have time to review them. Back to us being a volunteer project so people work in in their spare time.

**I'm an Artist**

Fantastic, but before you start making sprites we have an artist that we've worked with for years and we have a very precise plan forward for ground units.  That said, no one wants to make Aerospace Sprites and they are badly needed. 

Sprites need to be in a .png format, and submitted without shading or using the shading scripts found [here.](https://www.megamek.org/bb/thread-2295.html)

Other art such as Tilesets should be discussed before you put the work into them, often there are code limitations that can impact these.  If you have an idea for something art wise for the project please reach out to us.

**I'm a data guy**

Awesome, we have one of those too. We have to be very careful of what information we include in the projects due to copyright issues.  We also stay to canon when doing data - for example we wouldn't accept someones "Super Awesome 3025 RATs" unless that person can prove their data is based on canon.

We do have some data projects we would like done, but if you have the time and want to help, the best way is to join the Slack channel and look for Hammer. He coordinates the data stuff and can provide guidance.

**I can't do any of the above**

Good news! You can still help! Play the games, find bugs and post them [(read this first)](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Making-a-Bug-Report).  

Also if you notice rules from Table Top that are missing, open an RFE (Request for Enhancement) on the tracker. If you do an RFE please include the page numbers and references to the rules.
