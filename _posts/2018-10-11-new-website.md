Welcome to the new website for the MegaMek projects! We have consolidated and updated information from the previous website in a nice new slick design. We are hoping that the new design will provide a nice entry point for new players as well as experienced hands. Feel free to explore and give us feedback on [Slack](http://megamek.org:3000/) or the [forums](https://www.megamek.org/bb/). 

The new website is being served up directly from GitHub using GithHub pages. We have tested the website considerably, but you may notice problems or errors as we roll it out. If you see something, please report it as an issue [here](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek.github.io/issues). We appreciate your help.
