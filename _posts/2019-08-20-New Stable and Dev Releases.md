We are pleases to announce that we have two new releases out. The 0.46.0 Stable Release, and 0.47.0 Development release.

They are available from the download buttons above. 

One question we often get is whats the difference between the the Stable and Development releases.  The Stable releases are what we consider the safest to play. Meaning they won't crash and potentially ruin a campaign or save game. Development (Dev) releases are where we are introducing new things, i.e Improvements to Princess code, or new rules or unit types.  Most Dev releases are pretty stable and we do need players to test and find bugs.

Can I play Stable and Dev at the same time?
Yes, have them in different folders.

Can I use my campaign(cpnx) file in both?
Maybe, but we recommend against that. Keep a copy of the campaign file in each folder and back-ups as well.

How can I help?
