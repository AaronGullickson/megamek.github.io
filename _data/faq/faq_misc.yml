- question: "Why is the bot so stupid?"
  answer: "The new bot (Princess) is substantially better than the original \"Test\" bot that MegaMek used for years. However, there still may be circumstances where the bot is unaware of some rules options or performs poorly in certain terrains/conditions. For the best experience, either play against another human or don't use unusual settings."
- question: "Are the dice conspiring against me?"
  answer: "Short answer: No. Long answer: The dice use the standard Java
  random number generation routines. You can find them described
  in the Sun documentation. The same routine is used for every
  dice roll in the game. These routines have been tested, and they
  behave as closely as possible to real dice as is possible on a
  computer. To put it another way, every time the virtual die is
  rolled, it stands a one-in-six chance of generating each number,
  one through six and each roll is independent of the previous rolls."
