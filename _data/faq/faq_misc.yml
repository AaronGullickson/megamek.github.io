- question: "Why is the bot so stupid?"
  answer: "The bot has not been overhauled for a long time and is completely
  unaware of many of the new optional rules available in MegaMek,
  so it will do stupid things like jump off of cliffs if you let it.
  For the best bot experience, play with a minimum of extra options
  enabled. We plan on making the bot better at some point, but right
  now our priority is on other issues."
- question: "Are the dice conspiring against me?"
  answer: "Short answer: No. Long answer: The dice use the standard Java
  random number generation routines. You can find them described
  in the Sun documentation. The same routine is used for every
  dice roll in the game. These routines have been tested, and they
  behave as closely as possible to real dice as is possible on a
  computer. To put it another way, every time the virtual die is
  rolled, it stands a one-in-six chance of generating each number,
  one through six."
