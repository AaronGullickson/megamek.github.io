- question: "When I turn on the \"Canon Units Only\" option, I lose a bunch of units that I know should be canon." 
  answer: "We are currently in the process of recoding the canon status of
  all units as part of the Master Unit List project. Please be
  patient."
  
- question: "Why can't I find a particular unit?"
  answer: "<p>
    There are three possibilities:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Did you check the different rules levels? Perhaps the unit you are looking for is Advanced or Experimental</li>
    <li>We forgot to add it, then please report it either to the bug tracker or the forums.</li>
    <li>The unit has not yet passed the two months moratorium period since its official Record Sheet got released. You will have to wait that that happens.</li>
  </ol>"
- question: "Why is a particular unit marked as illegal when it fits the official Record Sheet?"
  answer: "Most of the times that means that the unit is using
  ferro-fibrous armor and is using the old armor rules,
  superceded by TechManual. Armor is now always rounded down,
  making some units overweight until a new Record Sheet is
  released."
