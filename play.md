#### Learning the Rules

MegaMek uses the rules from the [*Total Warfare* series of books](https://bg.battletech.com/books/core_rulebooks/) from [Catalyst Game Labs](https://www.catalystgamelabs.com/). Although we provide a variety of instructions within the programs of how things work, we do assume that players are familiar with the rules. 

If you are not familiar with the rules but would like to try MegaMek out, you can download the [free quickstart rules](http://bg.battletech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/BattleTechQuick-Start-Rules.pdf?x64300) to get started. 

- To learn more about the basic rules, you should get the [*Total Warfare* core rulebook](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=total-warfare).
- to learn the rules of unit construction used by MegaMekLab, you should get the [*Tech Manual*](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=1095-2).
- To learn about many of the optional settings available in the program, you should get the [*Tactical Operations* rulebook](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=tactical-operations).
- To learn about using warships in large scale space-battles, you should get the [*Strategic Operations* rulebook](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=strategic-operations).
- More information about campaign options used in MekHQ is available in the [*Campaign Operations* rulebook](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=campaign-operations).

#### A First Game of MegaMek

The instructions in this section will help you quickly get a small game of MegaMek up and running against the built-in AI. 

1. At the splash screen, choose "Start a new game." You will be prompted to enter your name. This is how your player name will show in-game. You do not need to enter a server password. 
2. You will now be taken to the lobby where you can prepare your units, the AI, and the map. There are a lot of customizable options here, but we are going to focus on the basics.

3. Select the button "Add a Combat Unit". This will pull up a dialog that you can use to search the more than 5000 units you can add to a game. For now lets just use the filter to search for a Warhammer WHM-6D. If you just type "Warhammer" into the filter, you will see all the Warhammer units available. Choose the WHM-6D and hit "Select." Now lets also add a Wolverine WVR-6M using the same procedure (I like "W" mechs). Now you can close the dialog. You will see both units on your unit list to the right.

4. Now lets add an AI Bot to fight against. Click the button "Add Bot". This will bring up the bot configuration dialog. You want to make sure you are using the "PrincessBot" and not "TestBot." You can fiddle with various settings to change the behavior of the Princess bot, but for now we will leave everything at the defaults. If you want you can change the name of the bot player at the bottom. Once you are satisfied with the bot's name, hit "Okay" to return to the lobby. 
5. Now lets add some units for the bot. Since its your first game, lets not make it too hard. Go to the "Add a Combat Unit" button again. This time, you will notice a little drop-down at the bottom that allows you to select your player or the bot. Choose the bot and select two Panther PNT-9Rs for the bot. Close out of the dialog and you will see both of your units as well as the bots.
6. We are not going to do much customization for this game, but we should at least choose some nice camo for our units. The big color button in the Player Setup section will allow you to select a camo. You can also select a camo for the bot by selecting it from the player list in the lower right.
7. The final step on this page is to define starting positions for each of the players. You can do this from the "Change Start" button in the Player Setup section. Since we left the Bot's home edge as North, lets have it deploy from the North and we will deploy from the South.

8. Now the last thing we need to decide is what hap to play on. Use the tab at the top to move over to the "Select Map" tab. We will stick with a the default 16x17 dimension map. Lets choose "Desert Hills" for simplicity of terrain features. 


![Map selected](/assets/images/first_mm_game/map_selection.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}

9. Now we are ready to play. Hit the "I'm Done" button in the lower right and hit the action. 
10. Your first screen will be the initiative screen where you will learn who won initiative and the order of movement. Hit the "Done" button in the lower right. In general, we will use that button in the lower right to say we are done with our turn. 
11. Now we can deploy our units. You will see the main game view of the board as well as a mini-map and a unit display. You can drag your mouse on the main screen to move your view around the map or click on an area of the minimap. Your unit display has tabs with important information about your unit, including pilot information, armor information, and weapon information. You will need to select a hex highlighted in yellow to deploy a unit. Hit done when you are satisfied with the deployment. Repeat with your remaining unit.

12. Now we are into the movement phase. Click on the hex you would like to move to and you will see a movement path. Moving across different kinds of terrain costs different movement points and each unit has different movement point available. If the path is blue, then you are only walking. If its yellow, then you are running. The faster you move, the harder it is to hit other units. On the other hand, the more hexes you move, the harder you are to hit. if a given hex on the movement path is greyed out, that move is impossible. You can also use the jump button (or the "J" hotkey) to jump your unit (if they have jump jets), which will show up in red. You can hit the backspace key to remove moves from your move path or escape to remove it entirely. You an also hold down the shift key to change the facing of your unit wihout moving into a new hex. Once you are satisfied with your mech's movement choice, hit done. Repeat with the other mech.

13. Now we move onto the firing phase. Select the unit you would like to target. Now look over at the unit display. You will be on the weapon tab. If you select a given weapon, you will see a report showing you the chances of hitting your target as well as any modifiers that apply. To fire with a given weapon, hit the fire button. You will see an arrow appear between your unit and the target. Continue firing weapons until you are done, but don't forget to keep an eye on your hit. When you have ready, hit the done button. Repeat with your remaining unit.

![Firing phase](/assets/images/first_mm_game/firing.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}

14. Now we will see a report from the weapons phase showing what attacks hit and what damage was dealt. I missed with all of my attacks. Hopefully, you did better. Hit done when you have read the report.
15. Now we will see the heat build up and end phase information. Hit done and you will be taken back to the initative phase and can begin the next round. Repeat until your opponents are destroyed and you win!
