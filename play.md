#### Learning the Rules

MegaMek uses the rules from the [*Total Warfare* series of books](https://bg.battletech.com/books/core_rulebooks/) from [Catalyst Game Labs](https://www.catalystgamelabs.com/). Although we provide a variety of instructions within the programs of how things work, we do assume that players are familiar with the rules. 

If you are not familiar with the Battletech rules but would like to try MegaMek, you can download the [free quickstart rules](http://bg.battletech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/BattleTechQuick-Start-Rules.pdf?x64300) to get started. 

- To learn more about the core rules, you should get the [*Total Warfare* core rulebook](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=total-warfare).
- to learn the rules of unit construction used by MegaMekLab, you should get the [*Tech Manual*](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=1095-2). Additional rules for a few advanced unit types are in the [*Tactical Operations* rulebook](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=tactical-operations) and the [*Strategic Operations* rulebook](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=strategic-operations). 
- To learn about many of the optional settings available in MegaMek, you should get the [*Tactical Operations* rulebook](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=tactical-operations).
- To learn about using warships in large scale space-battles, you should get the [*Strategic Operations* rulebook](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=strategic-operations).
- More information about campaign options used in MekHQ is available in and the [*Strategic Operations* rulebook](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=strategic-operations) and the [*Campaign Operations* rulebook](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=campaign-operations).

#### A First Game of MegaMek

The instructions in this section will help you quickly get a small game of MegaMek up and running against the built-in AI. 

1. Start up MegaMek using the OS-specific instructions on the [downloads](downloads.html) page.
2. At the splash screen, choose `Start a new game`. You will be prompted to enter your name. This is how your player name will display in-game. You do not need to enter a server password. 
3. You will now be taken to the lobby where you can prepare your units, the AI, and the map. There are a lot of customizable options here, but we are going to focus on the basics.<br>
![The lobby at startup](/assets/images/first_mm_game/lobby1.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
4. Select the `Add a Combat Unit` button. From the dialog, you can search the more than 5000 units you can add to a game to find the unit that is right for you. For now lets just use the filter to search for a Warhammer WHM-6D. If you just type "Warhammer" into the filter, you will see all the Warhammer units available. Choose the WHM-6D and hit "Select." Lets also add a Wolverine WVR-6M using the same procedure (I like "W" mechs). Now you can close the dialog. You will see both units on your unit list to the right.<br>
![Our units show on the right](/assets/images/first_mm_game/lobby2.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
5. Lets add an AI Bot as an opponent. Select the `Add Bot` button. This will bring up the bot configuration dialog. You want to make sure you are using the "PrincessBot" and not "TestBot." You can fiddle with various settings to change the behavior of the Princess bot, but for now we will leave everything at the defaults. If you want you can change the name of the bot player at the bottom. Once you are satisfied with the bot's name, select `Okay` to return to the lobby. 
6. Lets add some units for the bot. Since its your first game, we won't make these units very tough. Select the `Add a Combat Unit` button again. On the unit selection dialog, You will notice a little drop-down at the bottom that allows you to select your player or the bot. Choose the bot and select two Panther PNT-9Rs for the bot. Close out of the dialog and you will see both of your units as well as the bots in the unit list.
7. We are not going to do much customization for this game, but we should at least choose some nice camo for our units. The big squre color button in the `Player Setup` section is a camo selection buttion that will allow you to select a camo. There are lots of choices, so pick something here that fits your style or favorite faction. You can also select a camo for the bot by selecting it from the player list in the lower right and then selecting the camo button.
8. The final step on this page is to define starting positions for each of the players. You can do by selecting the `Change Start` button in the Player Setup section. Since we left the Bot's home edge as North, lets have it deploy from the North and we will deploy from the South.<br>
![Units are all ready to go](/assets/images/first_mm_game/lobby3.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
9. Now the last thing we need to decide is what map to use. Use the tab selector at the top to move over to the `Select Map` tab. We will stick with the default 16x17 map dimensions. Lets choose "Desert Hills" for simplicity of terrain features. <br>
![Map selected](/assets/images/first_mm_game/map_selection.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
10. Now you are ready to play. Select the `I'm Done` button in the lower right and hit the action. 
11. Your first screen will be the initiative screen where you will learn who won initiative and the order of movement. Select the `Done` button in the lower right. We will use that button in the lower right to say we are done with our turn in multiple phases of the game. 
12. We now move to the deployment phase. You will see the main game view of the board as well as a mini-map and a unit display. You can drag your mouse with the middle mouse button (or use two fingers on a Mac Powerbook) on the main screen to move your view around the map or you can click on an area of the minimap. You can also use your arrow keys to scroll around the map. The unit display has tabs with important information about your unit, including pilot information, armor information, and weapon information. You need to select a hex highlighted in yellow to deploy a unit. Select `Deploy` when you are satisfied with the deployment position. Repeat with your remaining unit.<br>
![Deployment phase](/assets/images/first_mm_game/deploy.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
13. Now we move to the movement phase. For the selected mech, click on the hex you would like to move to and you will see a movement path. Moving across different kinds of terrain costs different movement points and each unit has different movement points available. If the path is blue, then you are only walking. If its yellow, then you are running. if a given hex on the movement path is greyed out, that hex is impossbile to reach. The faster you move, the harder it is to hit other units. On the other hand, the more hexes you move, the harder you are to hit.  You can also use the jump button (or the "j" hotkey) to jump unit that are jump-capable. Jump movement paths will show up in red. You can hit the backspace key to remove a single step from your move path or escape to remove the entire path and start over. You an also hold down the shift key to change the facing of your unit wihout moving into a new hex. Once you are satisfied with your mech's movement choice, select `Move`. Repeat with the other mech.<br>
![Movement phase](/assets/images/first_mm_game/movement.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
14. Now we move to the firing phase. Select the unit you would like to target. Now look over at the unit display which will be showing the weapon tab. You can use this tab to select which weapons to fire. If you select a given weapon, you will see a report showing you the chances of hitting your target as well as any modifiers that apply. To fire with a given weapon, select the `fire` button. You will see an arrow appear between your unit and the target. Continue firing weapons until you are done, but don't forget to keep an eye on your heat build-up. When you have ready, select the `Done` button. Repeat with your remaining unit.<br>
![Firing phase](/assets/images/first_mm_game/firing.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
15. Now you will see a report from the weapons phase showing what attacks hit and what damage was dealt. I missed with all of my attacks. Hopefully, you did better. Select `Done` when you have read the report.
16. Now you will see the heat build up and end phase information. Select `Done` and you will be taken back to the initative phase and can begin the next round. Repeat until your opponents are destroyed and you win!


#### Options, Options, and More Options

You can customize your MegaMek experience considerably by experimenting with the various options that are available in the game interface. Those options are extensive, so we won't review them all here, but the list below will direct you to areas for further exploration.

- The `Game Options` button in the upper left of the game lobby contains a wide variety of options that you can use in your game. Many of these options are based on official game rules, but many are also unofficial rules based on commonly requested feature enhancements. Mouse over an option to learn more about it.  
- On the "Select Map" tab, you can select different `planetary conditions` that will change game play. These conditions include weather and lighting, as well as other conditions such as electro-magnetic interference. More information about these planetary conditions and how they affect gameplay is available in the [*Tactical Operations* rulebook](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=tactical-operations).
- Double-clicking on a unit in the unit list in the lobby will bring up a unit dialog with a variety of `unit and pilot options`. You can change the pilot's name, skill levels, and even add a portrait. If you enable special abilities or quirks in the game options, you can add them here. You can also change ammo loadouts, and set options for how the unit deploys. 
- You can use the `Random Skills` dialog in the lobby to assign skills to pilots using randomization, based on an overall skill level for your force.
- You can use the `Random Name` dialog in the lobby to randomize names based on a Battletech faction. 
- You can use the `Create Random Army` dialog to generate a selection of units for yourself or for the bot. You can base this on matching a certain level of battle value, pull from official random assignment tables (RAT), or use the force generator to generate an entire force, complete with a TO&E. 
- Under the `View` menu, you will find several options you can toggle that will affect the visual display of the map in-game. You can also visit the `Client Settings` and make changes there that affect the visual display of the game. 

#### Playing Other Humans

Playing against the bot can be fun, but playing against other human beings will allow you to experience the best MegaMek has to offer. The [community](community.html) page has more information on how to find other people to play against. Here we detail how you connect to games over the internet or a local network. 

When you start up a game of MegaMek, you also start up a server that other players can join. In order for other players to join, they will select `Connect to a Game` from the splash screen. They will then need to enter the IP address of your machine and the port number (the default port number is 2346). If you are playing over a LAN, then this will be your local IP address. If playing over the internet, you will need to figure out two things:

1. You will need to know your external IP address. You can get this from your router, from websites like [What is My IP](https://www.whatismyip.com/), or by simply googling "what is my IP address?" 
2. In most situations, you will need to configure your router to forward requests to port 2346 (or a different port if you changed the default) to the computer you are actually playing on in order for other players to connect over the internet. This will vary by router, but typically involves using the router's web-based software to add [port forwarding](https://portforward.com/).

You can also run the game "hotseat" on the same computer. In this case, you want to open up two instances of MegaMek. Start the game with one instance and connect to `localhost` from the second instance. 

You can register your game when you start it up. This will list your game on our [list of servers](servers.html) and make it easier for other players to find. It will also list your external IP address. You will still need to ensure that port forwarding is working properly in order for other players to connect.

If you have problems connecting to your machine, you can also try running your game on a dedicated server. We do not run any official dedicated servers, but several members of the community run dedicated servers that you can connect to in order to play a game. In this case, both players will use the "Connect to a Game" option to connect to the dedicated server. If you would like to run your own dedicated server, you can follow our [instructions](wiki/ded_servers.html) for setting one up.

Once connected, you can chat with other players using the pop-up chat system from within MegaMek. You can also join [MegaMek Slack](http://megamek.org:3000) for chat. 

#### Customizing Units

Many players love to create their own custom units. The [*Tech Manual*](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=1095-2) contains base rules for creating your own units for most unit types and [*Tactical Operations*](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=tactical-operations) and [*Strategic Operations*](https://bg.battletech.com/?wpsc-product=strategic-operations) contain advanced equipment and construction rules for some advanced units.  

We recommend building custom units with MegaMekLab. The program is always kept current with MegaMek and MekHQ. MegaMekLab can currently build the following unit types:

* Meks (Including Industrial, Super Heavy, Tripod, LAMs)         
* Aerospace Fighters
* Conventional Fighters
* Combat Vehicles (vehicles with a BAR rating are currently not supported)
* BattleArmor
* Infantry
* Dropships
* Small Craft
* Jumpships
* Warships
* Space Stations.
* Primitive versions of the units listed above

**Planned for 2019**
* ProtoMeks
* Support Vee's (from the TechManual)

The best way to manage custom units in Megamek is to create a folder called "Customs" in the `data\mechfiles` folder. Simply build the unit in MegaMekLab and save it to your customs folder. Make sure the file saves with either it's BLK extension (or MTF for meks).  Once you start MegaMek, the unit will be added to your list of available units.

If you can't find your newly created unit in Megamek or MekHQ, check the game's date and the available tech level in the game options. As a last option go into the `data\mechfiles` folder and delete the file called `units.cache`. On restart Megamek will rebuild this file and your custom unit should show up.

When you upgrade to a new version of MegaMek, you can copy your custom folder over to the new version. 

##### Other Builders

We can't guarantee that builders other than MegaMekLab (e.g. Heavy Metal Pro, Solaris Skunkwerks) will work with Megamek.  Megamek is a program in constant development, and while we do our best to ensure backwards compatibility it's not always possible.  Other building programs might not keep current with our name systems or file formats. As such this files might not load, or in extreme cases crash Megamek. 

#### A First Campaign in MekHQ

MekHQ is designed to be customizable to a variety of different campaign styles (e.g. mercenary, house command, pirates, clan warriors, small units, large units, highly narrative) and play styles. Its impossible to summarize all of the ways in which you could make use of MekHQ here. Many players enjoy using the community built Against the Bot rules which will automate many of the processes such as selection of missions, scenarios, and OpFor.

In the step-by-step tutorial below, I outline how to start up a very simple campaign, assign units and pilots and run a first scenario. For my example, I am going to go classic Mechwarrior 2 and run a Refusal War campaign as Clan Wolf loosely based on the excellent [*The Falcon and the Wolf* scenario pack](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/107737/BattleTech-The-Falcon-and-the-Wolf?cPath=4328_4541).

1. When you first start up MekHQ, choose `Start a New Campaign`. You will then be presented with a dialog to choose the start date of your campaign. Since I will be playing the Refusal War, I will start my campaign on 24 September 3057. 
2. You will now be presented with several different selectable preset campaign types. These campaign types will preset many of the game options for you, although you can still customize them as you like later. For this tutorial, we are going to choose the `Simple Presets` option so that we can get going quickly.<br>
![preset_selection](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/game_preset.png){:class="img-fluid w-50"}
3. You will now be presented with a dialog that gives you a multitude of options to customize the campaign to your liking. On the first tab, you will want to assign a name for your campaign, select a faction, and select a camo. I have also made a few other minor tweaks that are not essential. 
    1. On the Repair and Aquisition tab, I lower the minimum transit time for deliveries to zero.
    2. On the personnel tab, I de-selected `Capture Prisoners in ccenario`. 
    3. On the Rank System tab, I chose to use a `Clan rank system`.
    4. On the Name and Portrait Generation tab, I de-selected automatic portrait generation for mechwarriors, because I want to choose my own portraits. 
    <br>
    ![preset_selection](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/game_options.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
4. You will now be presented with the main MekHQ application which contains many tabs and a lot of functionality. I am going to start by adding my mechs and pilots, and then I will organize them into a TO&E for a scenario. First, I turn `GM Mode` on with the button in the upper right. This will allow me to take certain actions that I wouldn't be able to do otherwise. 
5. I can hire my mechwarriors as a group by going to the `Marketplace > Hire Personnel in Bulk` menu item. I am going to run a full trinary, so I need fifteen mechwarriors. I start them all at the rank of Warrior. MekHQ will randomize their skill levels using the random generations guidelines set up in the campaign options.<br>
![hire_personnel](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/hire_personnel.png){:class="img-fluid w-50"}<br>Once you hit `Hire` you will see a report about the new mechwarriors on the right. All important happenings are shown in this report log. If I move over to the `Personnel tab`, I can see my fifteen new mechwarriors.<br>
![personnel_tab1](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/personnel_tab1.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
6. I sort my mechwarriors by skill level and make my most skilled mechwarriors the officers. I can do this by right-clicking on a person which brings up a context menu with a lot of options. I want to use the `Rank` selection option at the top to change ranks. I also want my Star Captain to have the same name used in the canon *The Falcon and The Wolf* scenario pack. To do that, I right-click again and go all the way down to `GM Mode` at the bottom and then to `Edit...`. From the pop-up dialog, I can change a lot of characteristics about my personnel. Finally, I also use the `Change Portrait` option from the right-click menu to give portraits to all of my mechwarriors. Note that these portaits are not included with MekHQ and are from my own collection. However, you can find a lot of useful portrait packs in the community for your use. I can also use the `Graphic` View at the top to get a nice look at my team.<br>
![personnel_tab2](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/personnel_tab2.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
7. Now, lets get these mechwarriors some mechs! Go to `Marketplace > Purchase Unit`. From this dialog, you can find and select units. You can use the `Buy` option to acquire units, but this may force you to make an acquisition roll, spend money, and wait for delivery depending on your game option settings. Alternatively, you can use the `Add (GM)` button to just add the unit directly, bypassing all of the acquisition rules. Since, I have generated a trinary of mechs that I want to use by hand based on the rules in *The Falcon and The Wolf* scenario pack, I will use the GM button to add units. Once you are finished, you can close this dialog. Your new units will appear in the `Hangar tab`.<br>
![hangar_tab1](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/hangar_tab1.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
8. I can now assign pilots to each mech. I do this from the `Personnel tab`. Right click on a pilot and then choose `Assign to Unit` and pick the unit you want. Continue until all pilots are assigned a mech. The personnel tab view is looking pretty complete now.<br>
![personnel_tab3](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/personnel_tab3.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
9. We can now build the TO&E. Lets go over to the `TO&E tab`. The top level force here says "My Campaign." Right-click on that to change the name. I am going to start my organization at the Galaxy level even though I only have a trinary, just for the flavor. So I name this top level force "Beta Galaxy." I also change the icon using the right-click menu. Luckily, there was already an icon for Clan Wolf Beta Galaxy. 
10. I now want to add a new sub-force. I right-click on my top force and choose add new force. I name this force "352nd Assault Cluster." Now, if I double-click on the top level organization, it will open up my full TO&E. I add an additional sub-force to the 352nd Assault Cluster for my trinary. Then within the trinary, I add three different stars. You can also play around with building force icons from `Layered Icons` for a slick military look.<br>
![toe1](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/toe1.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
11. Now that I have my organization set up, I can drop units into the specific Stars. Just right-click on a given force and choose `Add Unit` to bring up a list of currently unassigned units. Assign all of your units and you will have a complete TO&E.<br>
![toe2](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/toe2.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
12. We are ready for action. This is probably a good time to save my campaign from the `File > Save Campaign` menu option. MekHQ will save your save games in the `campaign` folder. It will automatically choose a name based on the campaign name and the date of the campaign, but you can change the file name if you like.
13. Now I can go to the `Briefing Room tab` and set up a scenario. First, I need to add a new mission. Missions are collections of scenarios that might be tied together in some way, such as part of a mercenary contract or planetary assault. Since my first scenario will be during the trial of possession over the planet of Colmar, I set "Colmar" as my first mission name and location. Then I use the `Add Scenario` button to add the scenario "Cutting Teeth" to this mission. I could also add some narrative text here for flavor, but I won't do that right now.<br>
![briefing_room](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/briefing_room.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"}
14. I need to assign units to my scenario. To do this, I move back over to the `TO&E tab`. I can choose any force or individual unit on the TO&E and right-click on them. Then I use the `Deploy Force` option to deploy my force to the scenario. If you return to the `Briefing Room tab`, you will see the forces listed for the scenario.
15. Now I can start the game. I have two options here:
    1. Use the `Start Game`. This will open up a game of MegaMek and assign your deployed forces into the game. From there you can assign OpFor and play against the bot or another human player. If you save your game and quit, you will be able to use the `Load Saved Game` to start up MegaMek from within MekHQ at a later time. 
    2. Use the `Export MUL file` option to export your forces to a separate file that can be loaded into MegaMek from the `Load Unit List` button in the lobby. This is useful if you want to play on a dedicated server. 
16. Once you are finished with your game and have declared either victory or defeat, you will be able to resolve the scenario in MekHQ. If you are running MegaMek from within MekHQ, then scenario resolution will automatically begin once you reach the victory screen in MegaMek. If you played on MegaMek separately, then you will be given an option to save your final file in MegaMek. You can then use the `Resolve Manually` button in MekHQ to load this file and begin scenario resolution.
17. Scenario resolution will ask you if you controlled the battlefield. This is used to determine whether you have access to all of that nice salvage smoking away on the battlefield. You will then be taking through a variety of dialogs that give you the status of your units, personnel, and salvage. You can edit any information here to your liking.<br>![resolve_scenario](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/resolve_scenario.png){:class="img-fluid w-50"} 
18. We have completed our first scenario. However, my units got pretty beat up. I should probably get them fixed up. I will need to add some Mech techs to my campaign in order to get my mechs all fixed up. I can use the same `Marketplace > Hire Personnel in Bulk` menu itemto hire fifteen Mech techs. Each of those techs requires a team of six assistant techs (astechs) to be effective. I could hire a bunch of astechs to solve that problem. However, I can also hire a pool of temporary astechs that I don't need to track in my personnel. To do this, I use the menu to go to `Marketplace > Astech Pool > Bring All Tech Teams to Full Strength`. On the bottom of the screen, the total number of temporary astechs will now be showing. Finally, I will need to use the `Advance Day` button to assign available minutes of work to my tech teams.
19. I can now move over to the `Repair Bay tab` where I will see a list of all my damaged units. Selecting on a unit will bring up an overview of the unit and a list of all the repair tasks that need to be completed in order to fix up this unit. <br>![repair_bay1.png](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/repair_bay1.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"} 
20. Unforunately, all of my tasks are greyed out because I have no available supplies for repairs. To get supplies, I click on the  `Parts Acquisition` button. This will bring up a dialog that shows all of the various parts required in order to complete repairs, with various options about how to acquire them. Since I have set up automatic and instantaneous acquisition, I will just select the `Order All` button. Depending on how you have set up your game options, parts ordering could required successful acquisition rolls, cost money, and take time for delivery. Remember to plan ahead!<br>![part_acquisition](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/part_acquisition.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"} 
21. When I return to the `Repair Bay tab`, I will now be able to complete repairs with my new parts. When you select a repair task and a tech, you will be shown the target number and modifiers for successfully completing the task. Hit `Do Task` to attempt the repair. Keep in mind that, under the standard rules, if a tech of a certain skill level fails a repair then that repair can only be done by a tech of a higher level. Also keep an eye on how much time each repair takes and how much time your tech has left. If a tech takes on a repair without sufficient time, it will not be completed until the next day. You can also right-click on a task to explore options to reduce time and/or the target number.<br>![repair_bay2](/assets/images/first_mhq_game/repair_bay2.png){:class="img-fluid w-75"} 
22. I focus first on getting my units fit for the next battle and then I can focus on salvaging or repairing any enemy units. Once everything is fixed, I am ready for the next battle of the campaign!
