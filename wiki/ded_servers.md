### Running a Dedicated MegaMek Server 

To start a dedicated server, use the -dedicated command line switch. A dedicated server just runs the server, in the console, without a "host" player in the game. People, including yourself, can join it like a game with a host. The dedicated server reads the password and port options from the clientsettings.xml file, or uses the default (no password and port 2346.) If you want the dedicated server to load a saved game, supply the filename after the -dedicated switch, like this: -dedicated savedgame.sav. To stop the server, you will need to tell the Java machine to halt execution, which is CTRL + C on most platforms.
