              MegaMek will run on any operating system that can run Java 8
              including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Although it will run on later
              versions of Java, your experience will vary.

              MegaMek comes in a zip file. You will need to unzip it using an
              appropriate unzipping utility. For example, you could use 7-Zip or
              WinZip on windows. Simply unzip MegaMek into the directory of your
              choice. We recommend that you do not unzip a new release into the
              same directory as an older release, as this can often cause
              problems if files have changed. As of version 0.35.13, We are now
              packaging MegaMek in operating system-specific platforms. To run
              MegaMek on Windows and macOS, simply double-click on the MegaMek
              icon. In a *nix environment, you can run the startup shell script
              or run the program from the command line:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>java -jar MegaMek.jar &</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              On older versions, macOS users will need to double-click the
              MegaMek.jar file.

              Stable, Dev, Exp... Which Megamek release should I use?

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>
              The Megamek project uses several different types of official
              releases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stable releases are, as the name suggest, the most stable. These
              are released less frequently and have undergone the most testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Between stable releases the project has two more frequently
              released versions. The first of which is the dev snapshot
              releases. These are released periodically during the development
              process and will contain new features that are being worked that
              aren't yet in the stable release. Since these releases are
              currently in development there is a much higher likelihood of
              encountering bugs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The final release type is experimental. These releases come from
              the experimental branch and generally contain changes that may not
              make it into development or are longer term projects. These
              releases may or may not happen depending on whether there are
              experimental changes currently in development.
            </p>
            <p>
              When making bug reports or asking questions about functionality,
              it is important to specify what release you are using.

              If you are using a version between 0.35.13 and 0.35.21, you will

              Mac fanboy here again, How do I open up multiple instances of MegaMek?

              By default, OSX applications will only open a single instance. To
              open up a second instance of MegaMek, you will have to use the
              Terminal application (in Application/Utilities). Navigate to your
              MegaMek directory and type:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>open -n MegaMek.app &</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              The “-n” argument tells OSX to open up a new instance of the
              application.

              If you are hosting a game over the internet, and other people
              cannot connect to your address, then you probably have port
              forwarding disabled in your router. You will need to allow port
              forwarding from the router to your computer on the port that
              MegaMek is using (2346, by default). How to do this will vary
              depending upon what type of set up you have for connecting with
              the internet. Check the instructions for your router. You can also
              try portforward.com, which has instructions on how to forward
              ports for many routers.

            <p>
              By default, MegaMek uses up to 1024 megabytes (1 gigabyte) of
              memory. This amount of memory is sufficient for most games, but
              when playing large games against the bot, higher amounts of memory
              can boost performance. How you change the maximum memory allowed
              varies by operating system. On windows, open up the
              MegaMek.l4j.ini file and change the line that says “-Xmx1024m” to
              the amount of memory you want. For example, if you want 512
              megabytes of memory, you would change this line to “-Xmx512m”. On
              macOS, you want to right-click on the MegaMek icon and choose
              “Show Package Contents.” Then open up Contents/Info.plist. Look
              for the line that says “-Xmx1024m” and edit this as above. On a
              *NIX system you will need to edit the startup.sh file's last line,
              or just add the memory argument directly to your java command if
              launching manually. For example:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>java -Xmx512m -jar MegaMek.jar &</code>

              It depends what operating system you are on, but in every case you
              will need to do it from the command line (DOS on Windows,
              Terminal/Xterm on macOS and unix). Navigate to your MegaMek
              directory and type:
            </p>
            <p>
              Windows: <code>MegaMek -dedicated -port XXXX</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              macOS: <code>open MegaMek.app –args -dedicated -port XXXX &</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              *nix: <code>java -jar MegaMek.jar -dedicated -port XXXX &</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Where you replace XXXX with the port you would like to use. On a
              *nix/macOS system, we also recommend you preface your command with
              a <kbd>nohup</kbd> command to avoid interruption. You can test your
              dedicated server now by opening a new MegaMek window and connecting
              to localhost on the given port number. On macOS, note that you
              will need to use the “-n” argument to open up a new instance of
              MegaMek, once your dedicated server is running.

              The bot has not been overhauled for a long time and is completely
              unaware of many of the new optional rules available in MegaMek,
              so it will do stupid things like jump off of cliffs if you let it.
              For the best bot experience, play with a minimum of extra options
              enabled. We plan on making the bot better at some point, but right

            <p>
              Short answer: No. Long answer: The dice use the standard Java
              random number generation routines. You can find them described
              in the Sun documentation. The same routine is used for every
              dice roll in the game. These routines have been tested, and they
              behave as closely as possible to real dice as is possible on a
              computer. To put it another way, every time the virtual die is
              rolled, it stands a one-in-six chance of generating each number,
              one through six.

              The developers work on MegaMek as a hobby. This is nice for us,
              since we enjoy it, and nice for you since we’re able to give you
              this program for free. However, it means the only honest answer
              to this question is that we’ll work on rule/feature X when it
              interests us. If this isn’t fast enough..

              Certainly! MegaMek is open source and anybody is welcome to
              contribute. A great way to get involved is to fix a bug or
              implement a new feature, and submit your patch to the patches
              section on the project page. Organization is fairly informal at
              present. If you want to make sure you’re not duplicating someone
              else’s work, you might post a message in the forums to announce
              your interest, but otherwise, go wild.

              How would you like to help? Are you good with Art? Writing
              documentation? If you like playing best, submitting accurate
              and complete bug reports is always a big help.
